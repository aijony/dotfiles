* Description

/*This layer is old and probably doesn't work anymore*/

A layer designed to be paired with the [[https://github.com/aijony/dotfiles/tree/master/.scripts/ycmd][spacemacs ycmd setup script]]
Because [[https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd][ycmd]] is confusing to setup, though it is a beautiful compilation of auto-completion engines.

* Install

Requirements:
SVN
git
python
cmake
spacemacs

To install this script please run my [[https://github.com/aijony/dotfiles/tree/master/.scripts/ycmd][spacemacs ycmd setup script]]


To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(

  auto-completion
  syntax-checking
  ycmd
  better-auto-completion

  ))
#+end_src
